Description:

We created an app called Diet Cheater, it will allow you to have your cheat meals at a price and we are not talking money, we are talking exercise.  Our app allows users to input a food that will show total calories and amount the of burpees, jumping jacks, push ups and air squats the user will have to do in order to burn off those calories.

Motivation:

Our motivation for this app came from our passion for fitnessâ€¦  Like we are about to fit this whole pizza in our mouth. 
But on a serious note, this app will allow you to eat what you want while maintaining your calorie intake for the day.  It will then tell you what you need to do to burn it off!

6. In the search field you will be able to add the food item you want calorie information on.  For example if I search "Burrito" it will pull up multiple options for Burritos.

7. Once one of the items is selected it will save to your app with all the information you need on a particular food.  It will also show what exercises you can do to burn off those calories.
